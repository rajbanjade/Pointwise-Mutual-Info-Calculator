## Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) Calculator

Calculating PMI from huge collection of texts sounds simple but it is actually challenging. The number of word pairs can be huge depending on the number of words you pair each other, and requires large amount of memory. This PMI calculator, however, can calculate PMI from huge collection of documents (such as, whole set of Wikipedia ariticles) even in a normal workstation. But it has to go through multiple passes.

Additional information will be added soon.
